# Assignment 2 — Python Programming Exercises

This folder contains five Python programs completed as part of Assignment 2.  
Each script demonstrates the use of functions, recursion, file handling, loops,  
and general control structures.

## Files Included

- **a2_q1_numbers_and_squares.py**  
  Prints the numbers 11 to 20 on one line and their squares on the next line.

- **a2_q2_gcd.py**  
  Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the  
  Euclidean algorithm.

- **a2_q3_age.py**  
  Calculates a person's age from their birthdate in DD/MM/YYYY format.

- **a2_q4_hanoi.py**  
  Solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using a recursive approach and prints the  
  sequence of moves.

- **a2_q5_quiz.py**  
  Loads multiple-choice quiz questions from `quiz_questions.txt` and runs  
  an interactive quiz.

- **quiz_questions.txt**  
  A sample question file used by `a2_q5_quiz.py`.

## Notes

- Input validation is included where appropriate to prevent errors.
- All programs are self-contained and can be run individually.
- `quiz_questions.txt` must remain in the same folder as `a2_q5_quiz.py` for the  
  quiz program to function.
